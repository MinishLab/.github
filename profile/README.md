## Hi there 🥬

We are the minish lab 🍄! Welcome to our github page. We're a two-person ([@pringled](https://github.com/Pringled) and [@stephantul](https://github.com/stephantul)) open-source research lab, with a focus on Natural Language Processing. 
Our goal is to provide with usable and fun tools to make working with language data easy and fun.

* We like fast things, so we focus on small models. 
* We like "classical" nlp and machine learning, so no LLM interfaces here. 
* We like cpu-bound work, not everyone has access to GPUs or wants to pay big tech companies for using GPUs.
* We try to be as multi-lingual as possible: NLP work tends to focus purely on English, to the detriment of other languages.
* We write in Python, and use a pretty opinionated stack (uv, everything fully typed, everything fully documented, no exceptions).
* We try to be inclusive: if you'd like to help out, please let us know 🤗.

### Main goals

We aim to make software that is:
* Easy to use ⛓️
* Fun to use 🥳
* Opinionated 🤔
* Open for integration 🧲
* Original (does not re-invent the wheel) 🤸
* Fast 🚴

In short, this means we make software packages that do one thing well, and that let you do that specific thing, and integrate it into a use of your choosing.
We're not going to try and tell you what to do, we'll just show you what you can do, and we'll hope you have fun doing it.
